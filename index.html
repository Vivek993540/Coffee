<h5>Pour Over/Drip: Coffee Cone</h5>
<img src="./pexels-jessica-lewis-creative-67470.jpg" alt="Not availible" weidth="360" height="240">
<p style="width: 100%;">One of the oldest, simplest, fastest and cheapest ways to brew coffee is the drip method using a coffee cone and paper
filter. Hot water is poured evenly over coffee grounds in a paper filter. With gravity, the brewed coffee drips slowly
and directly into a cup or pot. Coffee cones are made of plastic, glass, stainless steel or ceramic. The shape of the
cone and their filters will influence the flavours. Popular brands include Melitta, Hario V60, Kalita Wave and Bee
House.</p>

<h5>Plunger/Press: AeroPress</h5>
<img src="./index.jpeg" alt="image not shown" weidth="50%">
<p>Relatively new, the maker of Aerobie Frisbee (Alan Adler) created and launched the AeroPress in 2005. The AeroPress is
plastic and comes in 3 parts. A filter sits in a coffee basket at the bottom of the brew chamber. Coffee grounds rest in
the brew chamber where hot water is added then immerses/steeps the coffee. To extract the coffee, a plunger is pressed
down creating air pressure to force brewed coffee through a filter and into a cup.</p>
